# Designing-Kalman-filters
- Repo contains workflow for designing Kalman filters.
- Entire work can be seen as a summarization of the [excellent book / repo by Roger Labbe](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python)
- Case studies on how to apply the KF workflow to practical problems are presented

## Book Summary
- Overview of the concepts presented in each chapter has been documented 


Chapter 9: Nonlinear Filtering

Kalman filters as covered only work for linear problems. Yet the world is nonlinear. Here I introduce the problems that nonlinear systems pose to the filter, and briefly discuss the various algorithms that we will be learning in subsequent chapters.
