# Designing-Kalman-filters
- Repo contains workflow for designing Kalman filters.
- Entire work can be seen as a summarization of the [excellent book / repo by Roger Labbe](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python)
- Case studies on how to apply the KF workflow to practical problems are presented

## Book Summary
- Overview of the concepts presented in each chapter has been documented 






Chapter 8: Designing Kalman Filters

Building on material in Chapters 5 and 6, walks you through the design of several Kalman filters. Only by seeing several different examples can you really grasp all of the theory. Examples are chosen to be realistic, not 'toy' problems to give you a start towards implementing your own filters. Discusses, but does not solve issues like numerical stability.

Chapter 9: Nonlinear Filtering

Kalman filters as covered only work for linear problems. Yet the world is nonlinear. Here I introduce the problems that nonlinear systems pose to the filter, and briefly discuss the various algorithms that we will be learning in subsequent chapters.
